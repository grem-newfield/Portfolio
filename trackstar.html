<h2>Portfolio Project 2 Course: Racing Game in Godot 4.4</h2>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>
  As part of a student group project, I contributed to the development of a
  racing game built in the
  <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>. I proposed to create a
  Ridge Racer-type game, with focus on drifting and nature scenery. This means
  unique arcade-style drifting physics and unlike in a racing simulator the
  drifting around corners in this game should increase your speed to facilitate
  overtaking AI cars.

<h3>My Role and Contributions</h3>
<p>
  I took on the roles of Code Lead, Level Designer, and Level Artist, I took on
  a multifaceted role, both technical implementation and creative design. Below,
  I reflect on my contributions, the challenges faced, and the skills I honed
  during this work.
</p>
<p>
  Though not formally appointed as the project lead, I assumed a leadership role
  due to my experience with Godot, game design, and code architecture. I
  delegated tasks to team members based on their strengths, hoping for efficient
  progress while maintaining a cohesive vision.
</p>
<p>
  My primary coding contributions included designing a Manager System to handle
  the game's core functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>UI Manager</b>: Handles scene transitions for menus and race states.
  </li>
  <li><b>Tour Manager</b>: Loads game maps dynamically.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Player Manager</b>: Tracks player state (e.g., name, score, laps,
    timers).
  </li>
  <li><b>Save Manager</b>: Save/load with data validation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Physics-Based Car Simulation</h4>
<p>
  The fun part of the project for me was implementing a car using a RigidBody
  and raycast-based wheels. The car drives by applying forces at the raycasts,
  which simulate wheels.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Spring Force and Suspension</b>: Raycasts return a collision points with
  the ground every frame, and then I apply a force based on how far the spring
  is from its resting point. The force is scaled by the spring's stiffness to
  make the car's suspension feel bouncy, like real shocks.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Sideways Slip and Drifting</b>: Car is stabilized by applying lateral
  forces to counteract sideways slip. Only the rear wheels provide forward
  velocity, simulating rear-wheel-drive dynamics. At higher speeds, the lateral
  force curve is tuned according to a grip curve to permit increased slip,
  enabling dynamic and controlled drifting
</p>
<p>
  <b>Use of Curves</b>: The car's forces are scaled by curves that map speed to
  a force multiplier. As speed climbs, the top speed falloff curve gradually
  limits acceleration to prevent infinite speeding up. Steering force is zero at
  near-zero speeds, reflecting how wheels need to roll to turn effectively. The
  tire slip curve decreases tyre grip in at higher speeds, to allow for
  drifting.

<h4>Level Design and Art</h4>
<p>
  As a Level Designer and Level Artist, I crafted the game's environment using
  the Terrain3D plugin in Godot. This plugin allowed me to sculpt a heightmap
  with brushes and apply textures to create a visually rich racing track. I also
  focused on establishing a realistic atmosphere through careful lighting, fog,
  and environmental effects.
</p>
<p>
  In Blender, I modeled roads and their colliders to ensure player stays on the
  road. Additionally, I wrote scripts to export a list of assets I want in glTf
  and a B√©zier curve to JSON exporter for AI paths. Plus a complementary Godot
  plugin to import JSON data and generate path nodes in Godot.

<h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>
  There were no overwhelming technical challenges for me personally; I
  intentionally chose a straightforward genre and design to focus on group work.
  The main challenge was aligning the team's timelines and skillsets. I learned
  the value of structured team onboarding: setting clear roles, deadlines,
  check‚Äëins and consequences. I learned that even student projects benefit from
  a careful selection process, including informal "interviews" to ensure shared
  commitment.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Although the project was not completed due to varying levels of team
  engagement, I delivered fully functional core systems and became more skilled
  at working with Godot during this project. I will place more importance on
  choosing peers that are passionate about gamedev for the upcoming Portfolio
  Project 3 course.
